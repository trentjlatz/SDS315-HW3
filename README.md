# Exploratory Data Analysis & Bootstrapping
### Overview
In this project, I apply bootstrapping methods to a variety of datasets, exploring hypotheses related to gas prices, used car data, TV survey responses, and eBay advertising experiments. I used R, along with libraries like tidyverse, mosaic, and ggplot2, to conduct detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical inference, drawing conclusions based on confidence intervals.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
Bootstrapping for statistical analysis
Data manipulation and wrangling with tidyverse
Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation
Data visualization using ggplot2
Reproducible research with RMarkdown
### Datasets Analyzed
Gas Prices – Analyzing theories about factors influencing gas price variations (e.g., competition, income, stoplights, highway access).
Mercedes S-Class – Examining used car prices and characteristics such as mileage and color distribution.
NBC Pilot Survey – Analyzing viewer responses to TV shows in terms of happiness, annoyance, and confusion.
eBay Advertising – Assessing the impact of pausing paid search ads on revenue.
### Problem Breakdown
Problem 1: Gas Prices Analysis
Evaluated multiple theories about factors influencing gas prices, including competition, income levels, proximity to stoplights, and highway access using bootstrapping and confidence intervals.
Problem 2: Used Mercedes S-Class Vehicles
Analyzed the average mileage for specific car models and the proportion of black vehicles in the dataset using bootstrapping.
Problem 3: NBC Pilot Survey
Conducted hypothesis testing to explore viewer responses about happiness, annoyance, and confusion based on TV show surveys.
Problem 4: eBay Advertising
Analyzed the revenue impact of pausing paid search ads on Google using a bootstrapped confidence interval to assess whether it led to statistically significant changes in revenue.
### Tools & Libraries
R (tidyverse, mosaic, ggplot2, dplyr)
RMarkdown for clear, reproducible analysis
### How to Run
Clone the repository.
Open and execute the RMarkdown files in RStudio or any R environment.
Ensure all required libraries are installed: tidyverse, mosaic, ggplot2.
